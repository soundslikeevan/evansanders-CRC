My Cloud resume challenge files

I have spent some time studying IT Networking and decided, once I finished my degree, to focus on AWS Cloud and move my career forward into Cloud Engineering.

Part of that has been undertaking Forrest Brazeal's Cloud Resume Challenge to build an online resume with AWS services.


This repository is where I'm keeping the files needed to run my resume website, and run a CI/CD pipeline to keep it updated as I make changes.
